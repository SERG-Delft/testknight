<html lang="en"><body>Using this intention action you can quickly inspect the lines covered by a specific method invocation. If you have <b>Run with Coverage</b> before, this intention action will take you to the method declaration and highlight the covered lines. This relies on information collected during the latest coverage with tracing run.<br>
Therefore for it to work properly you first have to enable tracing by going to <i>Run -> Edit Configurations -> Code coverage</i> and select the <i>Tracing</i> option. Afterward, you have to run the test-suite containing the invocation with <b>Coverage</b>.</body>
