# TestBuddy Code Of Conduct

## Who is this code of conduct for?
The code of conduct has to be respected by all contributors of the TestBuddy project.

## Regarding comments and requests about the code of conduct
If you have some issues with or you want to add some more rules in the code of conduct, please schedule a meeting with all team members and discuss the issue.

## Communication between members
Team members will use for the communication Whatsapp/Discord/Gitlab. In case of contacting the client/TA/coach, the team members will use the Mattermost specific channels and/or email.

## On meeting scheduling and attendance
Meeting attendance is mandatory and team members should be on time. Meetings should be scheduled at a time approved by all team members. Exceptions can be made on an individual basis if a member cannot attend the meeting for a valid reason.

## Work times
We acknowledge that all team members require their own time aside from the project and thus canâ€™t be available at all times of the day. This changes from member to member(because of different time-zones). However, we expect all members to be available 
until 21:00 on their local time for group meetings unless they notify in advance.

## Handling and giving feedback
In case you have issues with the way or the quality of work of one of your teammates the following steps should be followed.

* In case you disagree with the quality of work please bring it up in a meeting or in code review, explaining why you think it can be better and giving suggestions on how it can be improved.
* In case you find issues with the way a colleague seems to work please first address this with them personally, reach out and see if you can help in any way. If that does not fix the issue please bring it up with the rest of the team.

## Handling task related issues
When working on projects such as TestBuddy it is only natural that you encounter trouble or issues that get in the way of your work. In case this happens please first of all try to address the issue on your own. Try to see if you can find anyone who has tackled this online. 
If after a sincere effort you see that you are still unable to proceed, please ask help from a team member. There is no shame in asking for help.

## Assignment delivery
* Issue delivery: The people assigned to an issue are responsible to for its delivery. If because of the problem they are not able to deliver it on time they should notify the rest of team on time. Moreover, that week's Scrum master should keep track of the progress on all the issues of the sprint.
* Group Assignment delivery: For the assignments that have to be written by the entire team one person will be assigned to submit them on a per assignment basis. Once the assignment has been submitted that person should notify the rest of the team. The team is then expected to verify that the submission was successful. If the deadline for the assignment is approaching and there is no submission by the responsible individual then the team needs to take action and assign the task to someone else.
